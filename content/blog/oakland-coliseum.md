The Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum. 1968-2024

The Coliseum is weird, man. I mean that in the most loving way possible. It’s actually falling apart. It would be apt to describe the interior walkways as bowels. There are none of the comforts you expect after visiting modern major league venues. 

I suppose it began with a 1970s party which never completely ended. At times the after party has been a little sloppy, but never out of character or offbrand. Expect to hear Earth Wind and Fire, James Brown, or Kool and the Gang on any visit. Despite some Frankenstein-like upgrades over the years, it is somewhat like going back in time - I'll admit not what someone might call charming like Fenway or Wrigley, on its face. 

But the vibes are everything. When it is filled (even partially) with Oakland A’s fans it comes to life. A's fans are an eclectic group of people bound by a proud tradition of excellence and underdog grit.

You'd see tailgating bbq, EZ-up tents, camp chairs, a scruffy guy carrying a 12 pack under his arm, cheap drinks being sold out of a rolling cooler, street food carts, and peanut vendors outside the gates. You'd see homemade banners and t-shirts. You'd hear noisemakers and drums. You'd see fans with tattoos, leather, wild hairdo’s, sometimes questionable hygiene decisions - none if this is ever unwelcome though. So wrong but so right. It is all part of the Oakland A’s ethos and DNA.

There was nothing quite like seeing the Coliseum at full capacity - a celebration but also clearly under great strain. Bathrooms, concessions, walkways, lighting, all buckling under the weight of the task. But it was electric. Nothing was terribly polished but the passion was overflowing, in total support of this team and our shared history - witnessing history together.

To summarize the Oakland A's in a single game - May 7, 2019, following a 90-minute delay due to a lighting malfunction, Mike Fiers pitches a no hitter.

Subversive and rebellious - both the people in the stands and the teams constructed on the field. The mustache gang. The bash brothers. The 90s mullets. Moneyball. Post-Moneyball. 

Like the Coliseum itself, these teams were at times held together with twine and duct tape. But a proud and durable tradition of excellence was never in question. Even at low points such as 1997, it always felt like the next contending team was right around the corner.

A tradition of overperforming expectations with the sum always being greater than the individual parts, rosters were built with prospects, trade returns from the last selloff, castoffs, journeymen, hall of famers looking to make one last run. These players don’t always fit anywhere else. They fit Oakland and they can win games together.

Matt Stairs, John Jaha, Mike Piazza, Frank Thomas, Geronimo Berroa, Bartolo Colon, Scott Kazmir, Rich Hill, Liam Hendriks, Brandon McCarthy, Jack Cust, Brandon Moss, Brent Rooker. I'm just rattling off names. The list goes on.

A franchise, a roster, and a fanbase with nothing to lose and everything to gain is dangerous. You don’t want to draw the A’s in a playoff series. You might get through but you’re gonna have to play two games at the Coli. You will not be welcomed warmly ... and the toilets might clog in the visitor clubhouse.

1972, '73, '74, '89. Yes. 

But also 1971, '75, '81, '88, '90, '92. 2000, '01, '02, '03, '04, '06, '12, '13, '14, '18, '19, '20. These were good teams which ultimately couldn’t get the job done in October. It pains me that I’ll never get to see a World Series game at the Coliseum. But I take some small comfort in the number of chances we had.

For several reasons over the decades, practically no one played an entire career of any length entirely with Oakland. Teams tended to be constructed of players young and old, or players in their prime years looking for a second (or third or fourth...) chance to prove themselves. There was no wealth or will to sign vanity contracts to keep a player in the franchise until retirement, the way teams like the Yankees or Cardinals would. You inevitably see long time players like Sal Bando or Eric Chavez have final chapters with other franchises.

This all fits the narrative. There is no storybook ending. No farewell tour. Thank you for all the wonderful memories, Oakland.
