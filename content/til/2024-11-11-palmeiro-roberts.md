Today I learned about this connection between All-Stars Rafael Palmeiro and Brian Roberts.

<!--more-->

Brian Roberts was a supplemental first-round draft pick by the Orioles in 1999. This was a compensation pick the Orioles received when Rafael Palmeiro left the team for free agency following the 1998 season. Palmeiro returned to the Texas Rangers, where he previously played from 1989 to 1993.
