During the five-season stretch from 2012 through 2016, Mike Trout piled up a staggering 47.1 WAR — the best mark for any position player in the sport and nearly 15 wins clear of his closest pursuer.

- Robinson Cano (32.5), Adrian Beltre (30.5), Josh Donaldson (30.3) and Miguel Cabrera (29.6) were the only other hitters to crack 30 wins above replacement during that window.
- Trout claimed the 2012 AL Rookie of the Year award in a landslide, outpacing Yoenis Cespedes (4.0 WAR) with his 10.5 WAR debut season.
- He won AL MVP honors in 2014 and 2016 and finished runner-up in 2012, 2013 and 2015 despite leading the league in WAR each time — losing to Cabrera's 2012 Triple Crown (7.1 WAR to Trout's 10.5), Cabrera again in 2013 (7.5 to 8.9) and Donaldson in 2015 (7.4 to 9.5).
- Trout conceivably could have opened his career by sweeping the 2012 Rookie of the Year and the next five AL MVP trophies.
- Clayton Kershaw was the top pitcher by WAR over the same 2012-16 span, racking up 35.4 wins in his age-24 through age-28 seasons.
