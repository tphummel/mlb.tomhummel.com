The [1994 all star game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game) was stacked with future hall of famers. It was a great game to boot. 59,568 fans in Pittsburgh at Three Rivers Stadium. I learned a cool tidbit about Randy Johnson.

Randy Johnson appeared in 8 all-star games in his career. Across those appearances, he gave up a single ASG home run. It was to Marquis Grissom in 1994, an opposite field solo shot that just barely snuck over the wall and inside the foul pole.
