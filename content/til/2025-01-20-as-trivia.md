Here are a handful of baseball nuggets I stumbled upon today.

- If you took away all of Hank Aaron's 755 home runs he would still have collected 3,000 hits.
- Rocky Colavito spent one season with the Kansas City A's in 1964, belting 34 homers and posting 4.1 WAR.
- Colavito finished second to Luis Aparicio in the 1956 AL Rookie of the Year voting. Tito Francona was the only other player to receive votes.
- Chris Bando — Sal's brother — made a brief appearance for the A's in 1989.
- Catfish Hunter hit .350 in 109 plate appearances for the 1971 A's, adding 1.6 bWAR at the plate to go with 21 wins and a 2.96 ERA.
- Since leaving Philadelphia, the A's have had just one 200-hit season: Miguel Tejada's 204-hit MVP year in 2002.
