Through 2024, Fernandez' debut season in 2016 at age 20 was the 68th best ERA+ (176) in the Expansion Era (Since 1961), minimum 150 IP. At age 20 his closest comparison was Fernando Valenzuela (source: Baseball Reference). 

He would have turned 32 during the 2024 season. What would his stats have looked like as we stand today? Through his first four seasons he had 38-17 record, 2.58 ERA, 589 strikeouts in 471.1 innings - adding up to a 14.2 WAR in a four-year career. What a loss for baseball.
