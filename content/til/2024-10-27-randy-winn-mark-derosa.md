Today in Immaculate Grid, I had two really nice picks: Mark DeRosa for Giants and Braves. Randy Winn for Giants and Cardinals.

# Randy Winn

Randy Winn had a nice career: 13 seasons, 27.5 WAR. His best WAR in a season was 4.8 in 2002 with the Rays at age 28 - also his only All Star selection. The fact that I got St. Louis correct for Winn was lucky. He played the second half of his final season in 2010 with the Cardinals at age 36 after starting the year with the Yankees. He played 87 games and 162 PA for the red birds. The Giants was more obvious as he spent four full seasons, 2006 to 2009 with the Giants.

# Mark DeRosa

Mark DeRosa had a 16 season career, 1241 games for eight franchises (Atl, SF, Tex, ChC, StL, Cle, Was, Tor). 10.6 WAR - largely due to his offense - he was neutral on defense in his career. His peak years were 2006-2009, including two 20-homer seasons during that span. His two seasons in San Francisco were in a utility role late in his career in 2010 and 2011.

# Final note

It's interesting that both Winn and DeRosa were part of the Giants organization immediately preceding their run of three World Series titles in 2010, 2012, 2014. As noted, DeRosa actually played for them in 2010 regular season but didn't appear in the Postseason.
