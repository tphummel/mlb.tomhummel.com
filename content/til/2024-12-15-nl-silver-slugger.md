After playing immaculate grid today, I had some learnings while browsing the NL Silver Slugger history. 

<!--more-->

- Mike Hampton has the most SS wins as a pitcher - 5. Ahead of Tom Glavine (4), Carlos Zambrano (3), Madison Bumgarner (2), Zack Greinke (2), Fernando Valenzuela (2). Hampton's five wins were in consecutive seasons 1999-2003. 
- Mike Hampton had four seasons in which he batted over .300 - .311 (Hou, 1999), .344 (Col, 2002), .320 (Atl, 2005), .328 (Hou, 2009)
- Yovani Gallardo won SS at pitcher in 2010 for the Brewers. 
- In 2012, Aaron Hill won SS at 2B for the Diamondbacks and Chase Headley won at 3B for the Padres. 
- In 2009, Matt Kemp and Andre Ethier (LAD) won two of the three SS in the OF (Ryan Braun was the third)
- Surprising outfield wins: Nick Markakis (Atl, 2018), Ryan Ludwick (StL, 2008), Michael Cuddyer (Col, 2013), Jay Bruce (2013, Cin). Not surprising in that they shouldn't have won, just a throwback to see their names.
