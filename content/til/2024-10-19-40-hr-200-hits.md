Of those 37 players, 25 have hit 40 homers and 200 hits in the same season at least once. 

The players who've done it more than once:

- Lou Gehrig, 5 (1927-1936)
- Babe Ruth, 3 (1921-1924)
- Mo Vaughn, 2 (1996-1998)
- Álex Rodríguez, 2 (1998-2001)
- Chuck Klein, 2 (1929-1930)

# Thoughts

200 hits in a season is a really difficult and somewhat arbitrary milestone to reach. You have to play every day. You have to be an exceptional hitter. But you can't walk too much as this will eat into your hits.

The list of 37 is littered with Hall of Famers, as you would expect. Two names I was a little surprised to see are Dante Bichette and Ellis Burks.

## Dante Bichette

Looking at Dante Bichette's career page, at first glance I thought there was a mistake. 1,906 hits, .299 career average, .835 career OPS but ... 5.7 career WAR? Looking closer, he was a heck of a hitter but an unmitigated liability in the outfield. He had a career defensive WAR of -16.2 wiping out most of the value he brought as a hitter.

## Ellis Burks

Ellis Burks had a very nice career. 18 season, 2000 games played. He was a slightly below average fielder but not really costing you runs and wins the same way as Bichette. 2109 hits, 352 HR, 1209 RBI, .874 OPS. His 1996 season in Colorado at age 31 was his career year. He was neutral (+0.6 dWAR) on defense. At the plate he had 685 PA in 156 games. 211 hits, 40 HR, 128 RBI, 1.047 OPS. He led the NL in runs scored (142), slug (.639), and total bases (392). He earned an All Star nod, Silver Slugger award, and finished third in NL MVP voting.
