# Editorial Guidelines for LLM Agents

- Always include `players` and `teams` arrays in the front matter of every post. Use kebab-case slugs for each entry.
- For TIL posts, keep the body short, direct, and information-dense. Prefer bullet lists or concise sentences that mirror provided facts.
- Use the term "WAR" consistentlyâ€”do not distinguish between bWAR, fWAR, etc., unless explicitly instructed.
- Avoid editorial flourish or speculation; only include the exact facts supplied in the task description unless additional research is requested.
